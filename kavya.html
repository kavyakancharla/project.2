On 6 February 2011, Chiranjeevi merged the 30-month-old Praja Rajyam Party with the Indian National Congress,[66][70] after two weeks of talks with Sonia Gandhi, the president of the Congress, which feared the no-confidence motion in the state assembly in the wake of the emergence of Y.

He got elected and took the oath as a Rajya Sabha member on 3 April 2012. On 28 October 2012, he was sworn in as the Union Minister of State (Independent charge), Ministry of Tourism, Government of India.[71]

Since the 2014 elections, he has stayed away from active politics and since then he has not attended any meetings of Congress. His tenure as Rajya Sabha member ended in April 2018.[79]</p>
